## Capital Budgeting (cont.)

### Sensitivity analysis

- Analyze the model's sensitivity to key variables
- Analyze best/worst scenarios
- Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Randomize many scenarios
  - Generate probability distribution for NPV and IRR

### Capital Rationing

- Hard = funds cannot be increased
- Soft = funds can be increased with justification
- Budget constraints set by managers
- Goal is to optimize NPV within the capital budget

### Discount rate

- Can use the SML in capital budgeting (Rreq = Rrf + Beta_project(Rmkt - Rrf))
- Discount rate should reflect risk of project, not risk of company (which is a basket of projects)

### Real Options

- Options that allow managers to make decisions at later dates and are dependent on future events or information
- Examples: timing options, abandonment option, expansion option, flexibility options, and fundamental options

### Real Options Analysis

- Calculate NPV without real option
- If NPV > 0, no need to estimate the real option value, otherwise consider the value of the real option

### Capital Budgeting Mistakes and Dangers

- Failure to account for economic responses
- Misusing standardized templates
- Pet projects of senior managers
- Using EPS or ROE to decide investment choice
- Using IRR when it conflicts with NPV
- Poor cash flow, overhead cost, discount rate estimations
- Politics of spending entire capital budget
- Failure to generate alternative investment ideas
- Incorrect use of opportunity and sunk costs
