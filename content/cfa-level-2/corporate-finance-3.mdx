## Mergers and Acquisitions

...
...

### Valuing a Target Company

1. Discounted cash flow method

- Determine FCFF
- Determine discount rate (target company WACC adjusted for merger effects)
- Discount cash flows to present
- Determine terminal value (constant growth or market multiple)

- Advantages:

  - Easy to model changes in cash flows from synergies
  - Might avoid biases in current market data
  - Easy to customize

- Disadvantages:
  - Difficult to model when cash flows are negative
  - Estimation error of the terminal value
  - Can be highly sensitive to the discount rate

2. Comparable Company Analysis

- Look at similar firms that were aquired
- Add a takeover premium to target's value to determine fair price

- Advantages:
  - Easy access to data
  - Value estimates come from the market (lower estimation error)
- Disadvantages:
  - The market might be valueing comparable firms incorrectly
  - Must determine takeover premium separately
  - Difficult to incorporate synerges or changes in capital structures
  - Historical takeover premium data might be outdated

3. Comparables Transaction Analysis

- Look at values of recent takeover transactions, not just comparable firms
- No need to calculate separate takeover premium

- Advantages:

  - No need to estimate a takeover premium
  - Estimates of value are directly derived from recent deal prices

- Disadvantages:
  - Past M&A transactions might be mispriced
  - Possibly not enough comparable transaction data
  - Difficult to incorporate synergies or changing capital structures
