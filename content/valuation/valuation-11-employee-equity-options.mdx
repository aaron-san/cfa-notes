## Equity-Based Compensation
- Options create a potentially value-decreasing overhang over common stock values
- There is a possibility that there will be more shares outstanding in the future
- Stocks (both restricted and unrestricted) and equity options granted to employees have a dilutive effect on equity

### Three forms of equity Compensation
1. Stock or Equity
2. Restrictied stock or equity - cannot be claimed or traded for a period after being granted
3. Equity options - allows employees to buy stock in a firm at a specified price over a period (often with restrictions too)

### Motivations for Offering Equity Compensation

- Aligning stockholder and management goals (alleviating agency costs - managers tend to accumulate too much cash borrow too little and make unoptimal investments without the right incentives)
- Cash deficiency
- Employee retention - a vesting period (required period of stay with the company to unlock the granted stock or options) incentivizes employees to stay longer
- Accounting and tax treatment - firms that use equity-based compensation have been allowed to report lower costs than firms that use cash-based compensation and there are sometimes laws that benefit firms that use options to reward employees

### Employee Compensation
- Stocks options that are granted reduce the value of equity since a portion of the existing equity in the frim has to be set aside to meet these eventual option exercises.
- Expected option grants reduce the portion of expected future cash flows that accrue to existing stockholders and thus the value per share today.


### Stock Options

<Note><span className="italic">Option Overhang</span> is the percent of options outstanding relative to total shares.</Note>
- The Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) estimated the option overhang for 1,500 companies at all stages of the operating lifecycle to be 17 percent in 2003.
- Firms that use options typically issue them every year with the strike price set to the prevailiing stock price (at-the-money when issued)
- These options are usually long-term (typically 10-year maturities)
- Options usually have vesting restrictions which require the employee to work for a stated period before having the ability to exercise the options
- Options that are deep out-of-the-money are nonvested
- Options are usually not transferable and are thus illiquid
- Options typically must be exercised if an employee leaves the firm, assuming they are vested
- For M&A transactions, outstanding options at a target firm are forcibly exercised

### Accounting for Equity-based compensation

#### Stock Grants
- The value of the stock grant is treated as a compensation expense when the grant is made and the number of shares increases in the firm

#### Stock Options (FASB 123R)
- The FASB began requiring firms to expense options starting in 2006
- Conventionally, firms could expense options only when they were exercised. The difference between the stock price and exercise price was expensed. This led to no expensing at the time of grant
- When options are granted they must be modeled using one of the following models
     - Binomial lattice model
     - Black-Scholes
     - Monte Carlo simulations
- The model must incorporate six inputs:
   1. Current stock price
   2. Price volatility
   3. Expected life considing maturity and vesting period
   4. Dividends
   5. Exercise price
   6. Riskless rate
- The model can be adjusted to reflect specific characteristics of the options
- Different models can be used to model different options within the same company
- The option has to be adjusted for expected forefeitures (can be based on historical patterns of forfeiture and exercise)
- The value of the options can be spread over the vesting period, starting with the year of grant (using straight-line or accelerated methods)
- Option expenses usually reflect option expenses from prior years as well
- If the actual forfeiture rate is different from the original estimate (used to value the options at grant), the option value must be reestimated and the expense must be adjusted

### Valuation Principles
- When a firm gives away something of value, we must record a transaction
- Additional outstanding options leads to more volatile stockholder earnings, and stock or restricted stock compensation leads to less earnings variability over time
