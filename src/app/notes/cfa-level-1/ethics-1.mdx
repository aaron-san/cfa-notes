## Professional Standards

I. Professionalism

    I(A) Knowledge of the Law

        - Reporting Violations:

            1. Inform employer’s compliance department and supervisor and attempt to remedy the solution
            2. Dissociate from activity (Resignation or reassignment)
            3. Inform legal or regulatory authorities

                - Must comply with the stricter of the law, rule, or regulation
                - Must not knowingly participate or assist in and, must dissociate from any violation of such laws, rules, or regulations
                - Members or Candidates can participate in a violation simply by having knowledge of the violation and not taking action to stop it
                - Ignorance of a rule or law is not a sufficient defense
                - Don’t have to report violations of laws or the Code and Standards to either the CFA Instute or governmental authorities, unless required by law
                - Must disassociate from any illegal activity and actively urge the firm (either an immediate supervisor or a compliance officer) to cease any conduct that violates the law or an applicable regulation or standard. Inaction might be judged, (even in a court of law), as participating or assisting, which violates the Standard.

    I(B) Independence and Objectivity

        - Must use reasonable care and judgment to achieve and maintain independence and objectivity - Must not offer, solicit, or accept any gift, benefit, compensation, or consideration that reasonably could be expected to compromise their own or another’s independence and objectivity
        - Gifts must be disclosed to the member’s employer in any case, either prior acceptace, if possible, or subsequently.
        - No requirement to notify “all related parties,” because it is the obligation of the employer to determine if loyalties to other clients will be affected. After permission is received from employer, receipt of gift is acceptable.
        - Gifts that are offered to demonstrate a firm’s product/service are acceptable and need not be disclosed
        - Must act as an independent source of financial incite, not reliant on other professionals for decisionmaking
        - Must not accept gifts that are hard to come by and most likely expensive since they pose a potential threat to objectivity
        - Gifts that are accepted for prior performance and not contingent on future performance don’t threaten objectivity
        - Gifts that are contingent on future performance must be authorized by a supervisor or compliance department
        - Gifts of significant value can be accepted as long as an employer authorizes acceptance AND the gifts will not threaten duty to other clients
        - Gifts that are a part of the required itiniery and not easily substitutable (such as special flights) can be accepted
        - Reasonable payment for hotel rooms and chartered flights is acceptable. Irrelevent or lavish hospitality could compromise objectivity and should be avoided.
        - Gifts that are given to inspire high performance are allowable, but if it is contingent on future performance, employer consent is required by supervisor or compliance department
        - Must not participate in oversubscribed IPOs
        - When providing analysis of a security AND maintaining ownership of the security, whether self-managed or not, member must disclose the ownership to appropriate clients.
        - Members may accept modest gifts, which it specifically defines as being anything worth less than US$100, as long as they do not affect objectivity.
        - Be sure there are effective “firewalls” between research/investment managemetn and investment banking activities
        - Do not confine research to discussions with company management; use several sources

    I(C) Misrepresentation

        - Must not knowingly make any misrepresentations relating to professional activities
        - All sources in an analyst’s report must be documented
        - except factual information published by recognized financial and statistical reporting services

    I(D) Misconduct

        - Must not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on professional reputation, integrity, or competence - Standard i(d) Misconduct primarily covers professional activities but also refers to any activities (professional or personal) that reflect adversely on members’ professional competence, integrity, or reputation.
        - Must not use CFA Instute’s Professional Conduct Program to settle personal, political, or other disputes not related to professional ethics
