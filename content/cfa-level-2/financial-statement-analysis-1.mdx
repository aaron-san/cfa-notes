## Financial Statement Analysis

### Inventories

#### FIFO vs LIFO

- In a period of rising prices, FIFO produces higher net income and higher ending inventory value
- In a period of rising prices, LIFO produces lower net income and lower ending inventory value
- LIFO conformity rule requires that if a company uses LIFO for tax purposes, it must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes
- LIFO liquidation occurs when a company using LIFO sells more inventory than it purchases during a period, resulting in older, lower-cost inventory being used to calculate COGS, which increases net income and taxes

#### Lower of Cost or Market (LCM)

- Inventory is reported at the lower of its historical cost or its market value (replacement cost)
- U.S. GAAP requires LCM for LIFO and retail inventory methods; IFRS requires lower of cost or net realizable value for all methods
- IAS: subsequent reversal permitted
- U.S. GAAP: subsequent reversal prohibited

##### Cost

- Normal cost of getting inventory into current condition and location
- Excludes: abnormal amounts, storage costs, selling costs, admin overheads

##### Net Realizable Value (NRV)

### Long-Lived Assets

- Depreciation Methods

  - Straight-Line: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
  - Double Declining Balance: 2 / Useful Life \* Book Value at Beginning of Year
  - Units of Production: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Estimated Production \* Actual Production
