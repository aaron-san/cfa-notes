## Credit Analysis

### Credit Risk

1. Default Risk
2. Credit Spread Risk
3. Downgrade Risk

- Credit ratings by the nationally recognized rating agencies assess **default** risk only.

### Releases by Rating Agencies

- Credit Rating - reflects the probability of default (short- and long-term debt) and the rate of loss (long-term debt)
- Rating Watch - announcement that the rating agency is reviewing a particular issue in advance of a potential rating change

* Rating Outlook

<Note>Total Debt = Current Liabilities + Long-Term Debt</Note>

### High-Yield Issuers

1. Bank debt
   - Loans acquired from banks
2. Reset notes
   - Bonds whose coupon rates are adjusted periodically
3. Senior and Subordinated debt

- High-yield borrowers typically rely on short-term, floating-rate, senior bank debt.
- "Senior Bank Debt" has a higher claim on assets than "Senior Debt."

## Liquidity

### Liquidity Factors

1. Money Supply (traditional guage of liquidity)
2. Appetite for Risk

Traditional Banks (Commercial Banks)

- Heavily regulated
- In return for regulation, banks receive (1) deposit insurance (FDIC) and (2) access to the Fed's discount window (guaranteed source of liquidity)

### Shadow Banking System

- The group of non-bank institutions that offer liquidity to the market
- The commercial bank's most important economic role is to accept funds from depositors and lend those funds to borrowers.
- Shadow banks raise money from individual investors and provide it directly or indirectly to firms and households, a function that was once exclusively the domain of commercial banks.
- Examples of Shadow Banks + Hedge funds + Private Equity Funds + Trading houses + Conduits + Structured investments + REITs + Collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) + Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)

### Funding Sources of the Shadow Banking System

1. Reverse repos
2. Asset-backed Commercial Paper

### Minsky Framework

1. Hedge Unit (borrower can afford interest and principal payments)

2. Speculative Unit (borrower can afford interest payments only)
3. Ponzi Unit (borrower can't afford interest or principal payments)

- In 2006, mortgage lenders were effectively granting at-the-money call options on the value of their properties.

## Term Structure and Volatility of Interest Rates

- Yield Curve Shifts 1. Parallel shifts 2. Nonparallel shifts: Twists + Flattening of curve (lower slope) + Steepening of curve (higher slope) 3. Nonparallel shifts: Butterfly + Positive butterfly shift (less curvature) + Negative butterfly shift (more curvature)

Factors Contributing to the Returns on Zero-Coupon Treasury Securities

1. Parallel shifts in yield curve (90%)
2. Twists, change in yield curve slope (8.5%)
3. Butterfly shifts, changes in curvature of yield curve (1.5%)

## Yields for Yield Curve

1. Treasury Coupon Strips
2. On-the-run Treasury issues
3. On-the-run Treasury issues and selected off-the-run Treasury issues
4. All Treasury coupon securities and bills

- The liquidity of the strips market is not as great as that of the Treasury coupon market.
- A problem with just using on-the-run issues is the large gap between maturities, especially after 5 years.

## Swap Curve (LIBOR curve)

- Advantages of Using the Swap Curve
- Pure Expectations Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates
- Liquidity Preference Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates
- Preferred Habitat Theory of the Term Structure of Interest Rates
- Valuing Bonds with Embedded Options
- Mortgage-Backed Sector of the Bond Market
- Agency Passthrough Securities issued in U.S.

1. Ginnie Mae - Issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) and possess no credit risk
2. Freddie Mac - Issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC)
3. Fannie Mae - Issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA)

- The most important characteristic of passthrough securities is their prepayment speed.

### Factors Affecting Prepayment Speeds

1. Prevailing mortage rates
2. Housing Turnover (interest rate path)
3. Characteristics of the underlying mortgages
