## Managing Individual Investor Portfolios

- Investment Objectives and Constraints ("RRTTLLU")

### Objectives Constraints

- Return
- Time horizon
- Risk
- Taxes
- Liquidity
- Legal and regulatory needs
- Unique preferences

## Typical IPS Elements:

- Client description
- Purpose of the IPS
- Identification of duties and responsibilities
- Formal statement of objectives and constraints
- Calendar schedule for portfolio performance and IPS review
- Performance measures and benchmarks
- Considerations for developing the strategic asset allocation (SAA)
- Investment strategies and styles (e.g., active, passive, semi-active)
- Guidelines for portfolio adjustments and rebalancing
  Reasons to Revise and IPS:
- Change in personal circumstances (e.g., change in marital status, health, income, etc.)
- Change in external conditions (e.g., change in tax laws, capital market expectations, asset availability, etc.)
- Large loss in the portfolio
  Individual IPS (Example statements)

### Objectives

- Return Requirement
  - "$XX annually for [living expenses, parent's care]"
  - "Formulate the return requirement" = list the spending needs
  - "Maintain real value of portfolio"
- Risk Tolerance
  - Always start with "average risk tolerance" as basis and look for key characteristics that diverge from "average."
    1. Ability:
    - "Long time horizon" (young, good health)
    - "Large asset base relative to expenses"
    - "Could reduce living expenses and gifts" (flexibility)
    - "Could alter lifestyle" (flexibility)
    - "Large portfolio relative to liquidity needs and the time horizon"
    - "Investment portfolio is only source of income"
    - "Wants to maintain real value of portfolio"
      2. Willingness:
    - Actions speak louder than words.
    - "Makes own investment decisions"
    - "Holds small number of individual stocks"
    - "No annual loss > 6%"
    - "Avoid high-risk investments"
      3. Overall:
    - If willingness < abilty, honor willingness. Recommend education or counseling to reconcile the difference.
    - If willingness > ability, honor ability. Recommend education or counseling to reconcile the difference

### Constraints

- Time Horizon

  - Long-term with 2 stages: (1) until dependent's care ends; (2) remaining years until own death
  - Pre-retirement/employment and retirement
  - If the expenditure is low relative to the portfolio, it may not be necessary to delineate a separate time horizon (i.e.,
    reallocated portfolio).
  - "Possible 3rd stage is needed"

- Taxes

  - Taxed as an individual
  - Consider usage of tax-sheltered account
  - Taxable: all taxes should be considered in portfolio decisions
  - Charitable contributions should be made tax efficiently
  - Always look for anything unusual, such as trusts, foundations, or charitable gifts.

- Liquidity Needs

  - Include only spending requirements that must be met by the portfolio; any expenses that exceed salary
  - $XX for next year's living expenses / dependent's care / charitable gifts
  - Emergency reserve (5-6 months' salary)

- Legal/Regulatory Concerns

  - There are no special legal or regulatory issues
  - Seek legal counsel to establish a trust (or succession planning) for surviving dependents'/heirs' care
  - Create tax-shelted accounts for dedicated purpose

- Unique Circumstances

  - Care for dependents
  - Large holding of an illiquid stock
  - Large holding of a low-basis stock
  - Socially conscious (responsible) investing (SRI)
  - Future charitable contributions
  - Desire to avoid particular stocks, sectors, etc.
  - Single with no dependents

### Profiling Individual Investors

- Situational Profiling (reasonably objective)
  1. Source of Wealth
     - Entrepreneurial activity (active)
     - Inheritance, one-time windfalls, built up over long periods of safe employment (passive)
  2. Measure of Wealth
     - Positive correlation between level of risk tolerance and perceived portfolio size (relative to spending needs)
  3. Stage of Life ("FAMD")
     - Foundation phase
     - Accumulation phase
     - Maintenance phase
     - Distribution phase
- Psychological Profiling (More subjective, bridges gap between traditional and behavioral finance)
