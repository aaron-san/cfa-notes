## Professional Standards (cont.)

### II Integrity of Capital Markets

#### II(A) Material Nonpublic Information

    - Must not act or cause others to act on material nonpublic information (information that would likely have an impact on the price of a security or that reasonable investors would want to know before making an investment decision)
    - Must make good-faith effort to prevent the transfer and misuse of material nonpublic information
    - Disclosure in widely-used news sources would likely cause traders to act

    <Note>
      **Mosaic Theory**: nonmaterial, nonpublic information combined with
      research can be used to make investment decisions and recommendations
    </Note>

    - An analyst conference call is not public disclosure.
    - Information is nonpublic until it has been made available to the marketplace
    - Recommended to restrict proprietary trading, but still make unsolicited trades
    - Should provide an information firewall to limit transmittal of material nonpublic information within firm
    - Common knowledge is regarded as "public" information
    - Should first make reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination and then, if necessary, disclose information only to designated supervisory and compliance personnel.
    - A firm's internal information "firewall" should include a reporting system in which authorized personnel review and approve interdepartmental communications.

#### II(B) Market Manipulation

    - Must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants
    - Must not spread false information
    - Whatever the motivation, the intent must not be to deceive market participants
