## The Basic Venture Capital Method

- Step 1: Determine the post-money valuation ("POST")

<Math>
  {"\\mathrm {\\small {POST =  \\frac{\\text {Exit Value}} {(1 + r)^t}}}"}
</Math>

- The only positive cash flow (capital gain, no dividends) in this model occurs at the time of exit (typically an IPO or acquisition)
- The Exit Value is an estimate of the value of a company at the time of an exit event, be it an IPO or an acquisition

<Math>
  {
    "\\mathrm {\\small {\\text {Exit Value} = \\text{Earnings Multiple} \\times \\text{Estimate of terminal earnings}}}"
  }
</Math>

<Math>
  {
    "\\mathrm {\\small {\\text {Exit Value} = \\text{PV(expected future cash flows)}}}"
  }
</Math>

- Exit Value measures the value of the company in the case of _success_

- Step 2: Determine the pre-money valuation ("PRE")

<Math>{"mathrm {small {\text {PRE} = \text{POST - Investment}}}"}</Math>

- Step 3: Determine the ownership fraction for the investor (f)

<Math>{"\\mathrm {\\small {f = \\frac{\\text {Investment}} {POST}}}"}</Math>

- Step 4: Determine the number of investor shares ("y")
- Step 5: Determine the price per share

## Investing in Commodities

### Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)

- U.S. regulator of futures trading
- Long-only investment in commodities is usually obtained via collateralized long positions in commodity futures, forwards, or swaps.

### Contango (Normal Contango)

- Futures price > Spot price Futures price > E(Spot price)

### Backwardation (Normal Backwardation)

- Spot price > Futures price E(Spot price) > Futures price

## Commodity Futures Returns

1. Collateral yield - the return on cash used as margin to take long derivatives exposure
2. Roll yield - the return from rolling forward the maturity of the derivatives position by closing out a current position and entering a new contract.
   - The long position experiences positive roll yields when markets are in backwardation; the long investor can buy the the commodity below the current spot price from a hedger.
3. Spot yield - the return on the spot asset

## Commodity prices decline for the following reasons (shifts in demand/supply):

1. Introduction of new supplies and new production technology
2. Subsitutiton of one commodity for another when prices rise 3. Reduction in the use of certain commodities in technological processes

## Supply and Demand

- Most of the fluctuation in commodity prices comes from changes in demand. Changes in supply are usually smaller and slower to respond.

Today's commodities market is no longer dominated by hedgers and natural backwardation and can move towards backwardation or contango.

At the maturity date of the futures contract, the investor can either take physical delivery of the commodity or roll the futures contract, which means buying another contract with a new maturity date.

The risk-return profile of commmodities over the past 25 years is similar to that of U.S. equities.

Commodities tend to have a negative correlation with equities and therefore provide some diversification benefits.

Portfolio optimization techniques suggest that portfolios should contain about 15-25% of commodities.

## Performance of Hedge Funds

### Maximum Drawdown

- The largest percentage decrease in investment value from peak to valley that has ever occurred for a fund within a specified time period.

### Measures left-tail risk

#### Value at Risk (VAR)

- The minimum loss that would be expected over a period of time as well as the probability of occurrence
- Assumes hedge fund returns are normally distributed (uses zstat and p-value)
- Assumes that component risks are additive

### Other Risk Measures

1. Loss Standard Deviation - standard deviation that focuses on the left side of the return distribution
2. Downside Deviation - similar to loss standard deviation, but specifies a minimum acceptable return (used in the Sortino Ratio)

## Hedge Fund Risks

1. Fraud Risk
2. Operational Risk
3. Investment Risk

## Maximum Drawdown

- A measure of the largest loss that can be experienced.

## Value At Risk

- A measure of the largest loss that can be experienced AND the associated probability of the loss event \* Assumes hedge fund returns are normally distributed
- Assumes hedge fund risks are additive
