## Goodwill
- "Goodwill is a result of acquisitions. It is the most useless intangible asset. It is a plug variable. Don’t pay for a plug variable." (Damodaran)

- Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires another company for a price higher than the fair value of its net identifiable assets.
- Goodwill is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset and represents the premium paid for factors such as brand reputation, customer relationships, and intellectual property.
- Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in the income statement.

## Research and Development (R&D) Costs
- R&D costs are expenses incurred in the process of discovering new knowledge, products, or processes.
- According to accounting standards, R&D costs are typically expensed as incurred, meaning they are recorded as expenses in the income statement in the period they are incurred.
- However, certain development costs may be capitalized if they meet specific criteria, such as technical feasibility and the intention to complete and use or sell the asset.
- Capitalized R&D costs are recorded as intangible assets on the balance sheet and amortized over their useful life.
- R&D costs whose benefits can be reasonably estimated to extend beyond the current period may be capitalized, while those that do not meet these criteria should be expensed immediately.

## Operating Leases
- An operating lease is a lease agreement where the lessee (the party using the asset) does not assume the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset.
- Operating leases are treated as off-balance-sheet financing, meaning the leased asset and corresponding liability are not recorded on the lessee's balance sheet.
- Lease payments made by the lessee are recorded as operating expenses in the income statement over the lease term.
- Operating leases are typically used for short-term leases or when the lessee does not intend to purchase the asset at the end of the lease term.
- Under new accounting standards (e.g., IFRS 16 and ASC 842), lessees are required to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for most leases, including operating leases, which increases transparency regarding lease obligations.

- The debt value of an operating lease can be estimated by calculating the present value of future lease payments using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate or the rate implicit in the lease, if known.
<Math>{"Debt value of operating lease = $\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{t} \\frac{Lease\\ Payment_n}{(1 + r)^n}$"}</Math>

<Math>{"Adjusted debt = Total debt + Present value of lease commitments"}</Math>
