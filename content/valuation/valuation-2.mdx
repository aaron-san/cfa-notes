## Discounted Cash Flow Valuation
- Changes in financing mix can be easily incorporated

<Math>{"Value of firm = $\\dfrac{\\text{FCFF}_\\text{1}}{\\text{WACC}-\\text{g}_{\\text{LT}}}$"}</Math>

<Note>The long-term growth rate for the firm should be less than or equal to the the growth rate of the economy in the long-term. </Note>

- Be sure that you use a nominal (real) cost of capital with nominal (real) cash flows and nominal (real) growth rate (e.g., nominal (real) GDP growth).
- The reinvestment rate (b) should be consistent with the long-term, stable growth rate.

<InlineMath>{"Reinvestment rate in stable growth = $\\dfrac{Growth rate}{Return on Capital}$"}</InlineMath>
