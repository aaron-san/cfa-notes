## Financial Statement Analysis

### Inventories

COGS = Purchases - Δinventory
Purchases = COGS + ΔInventory
IFRS does not permit LIFO




#### FIFO vs LIFO

- In a periodof rising prices, FIFO produces higher net income and higher ending inventory value
- In a period of rising prices, LIFO produces lower net income and lower ending inventory value
- LIFO conformity rule requires that if a company uses LIFO for tax purposes, it must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes
- LIFO liquidation occurs when a company using LIFO sells more inventory than it purchases during a period, resulting in older, lower-cost inventory being used to calculate COGS, which increases net income and taxes

##### LIFO Conformity Rule (U.S. GAAP)	
Firms that use LIFO for tax purposes must also use LIFO for financial reporting purposes	
	
##### LIFO Reserve	
- Cumulative difference in inventory from using LIFO instead of FIFO	
- Cumulative reduction in taxable income (increase in COGS) from using LIFO instead of FIFO	
	
- Cumulative tax savings from using LIFO instead of FIFO = LIFO reserve*Weighted-average tax rate	
- Cumulative reduction in net earnings/increase in COGS, net of taxes from using LIFO instead of FIFO = LIFO reserve*(1-Tax Rate)	
	
- Firms that use LIFO must disclose their LIFO reserve in their footnotes	
	
**Converting from LIFO to FIFO**

<Math>{"Inventory = Inventory$_$0 + LIFO reserve"}</Math>
Cash = Cash_0 - LIFO reserver * tax Rate
Retained earnings = Retained earnings_0 + LIFO Reserve * (1 - tax rate)

- Inventory increases by the LIFO Reserve. 												
- The cumulative taxes saved from using LIFO is subtracted from Cash (or added to Taxes Payable)
- sThe cumulative reduction in net income from using LIFO is added to Retained Earnings.												
												
LIFO Reserve = FIFO Inventory - LIFO Inventory												
COGSFIFO = COGSLIFO - ∆LIFO Reserve												
												
#### LIFO Liquidation												
Intentionally liquidating older layers of LIFO inventory.  Results in higher net income and higher taxes.												
This boost to income is unsustainable, as the inventory will eventually run out.												
Review the inventory footnotes for details on changes in the LIFO reserve.												
												
												
#### Inventory Valuation												
IFRS:												
Inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the lower of cost or net realizable value (sales price - estimaetd selling and completion costs)												
Inventory writedowns are reported as a loss on the income statement.												
Any writeups are reported in the income statement, but are limited to the amount previously recognized as a loss.												
												
U.S. GAAP:												
Inventory is reported on the balance sheet at the loswer of cost or market (replacement cost).												
However, market cannot be greater than the net realizable value (NRV), or less than NRV minus a normal profit margin.												
Inventory writedowns are reported as a loss on the income statement.												
No writeups are allowed.												
												
Reporting inventory is permitted under IFRS and U.S. GAAP in certain industries (e.g. agricultural and forest products, mineral ores, and precious metals).												
												
												
Finished goods inventories that is growing faster than sales may be an indication of declining demand and , ultimately, excessive or potentially obsolete (impaired) inventory.												
												





#### Lower of Cost or Market (LCM)

- Inventory is reported at the lower of its historical cost or its market value (replacement cost)
- U.S. GAAP requires LCM for LIFO and retail inventory methods; IFRS requires lower of cost or net realizable value for all methods
- IAS: subsequent reversal permitted
- U.S. GAAP: subsequent reversal prohibited

##### Cost

- Normal cost of getting inventory into current condition and location
- Excludes: abnormal amounts, storage costs, selling costs, admin overheads

##### Net Realizable Value (NRV)

<table style={{ width: "300px", border: "none" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ width: "70%" }}>NRV</th>
      <th style={{ width: "30%" }}>$</th>

    <tr>
      <td>Estimated selling price</td>
      <td style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

</div>

### Long-Lived Assets

- Depreciation Methods

  - Straight-Line: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Useful Life
  - Double Declining Balance: 2 / Useful Life x Book Value at Beginning of Year
  - Units of Production: (Cost - Salvage Value) / Total Estimated Production x Actual Production

### Equity Accounting

- Used when investor has significant influence (20-50% ownership)
- Indicators:
  - Board representation
  - Participation in policy decisions
  - Material transactions
  - Interchange of managerial personnel
  - Dependence on technology/intellectual property

- Initial investment recorded at cost and includes directly attributable transaction costs

- Investor's share of investee's earnings increases the investment account; dividends decrease it

- In subsequent periods:
  - Balance sheet: Cost + earnings/losses - dividends
  - Change in Balance Sheet: %Share \* Change in retained earnings
  - Income Statement: Earnings gain/loss (%share of NI)
  - FMV adjustments impact future earnings

      <td style={{borderTop: "1px solid gray", textAlign: "center" }}>X</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

#### Impairments
- IFRS: Carrying value > Recoverable amoount (where Recoverable amount = higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal)
- U.S. GAAP: Carrying value > Fair value (considered permanent)
- No reversals allowed
- Goodwill not separately tested

### Fair Value Accounting

- Can elect to hold investment at fair value with changes in fair value taken to the income statement

### Joint Ventures (p. 90 of CFA® Note sheets)
